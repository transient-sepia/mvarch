It's really straight forward:

 - set the following variables: FROM, DIR, NUM
 - execute the script like this:

     $ ./mvarch.sh

 - archivelogs are moved to the DIR directory, links to those logs are created in FROM directory.
 - you can now do a backup since the archiver is unstuck.
 - don't forget to remove the files in DIR directory since the links are symbolic.
